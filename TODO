    * FIX wireops/raw.py :: field_hdr_len(ndx, ftype), which
        ** incorrectly ** calculates the length of a field header
        given its field type: it needs to map this into a primitive
        type and determine the length tiven that

    * convert wireops FieldTypes to a simple Enum so that eg
        V_BOOL.value is 'vBool'
        - the FieldStr class and its as_str method disappear
